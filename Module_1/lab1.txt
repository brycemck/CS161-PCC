3.

	a) Initialize totalPrice variable as a double, and set it equal to 0.
	b) Read user input and accept only the values "mowing", "fertilizing", and "planting".
	c) Store the response from the above under the variable requestedService.
	d) Read user input again. If requestedService equals "mowing", ask for the square footage. If requestedService equals "fertilzing", ask how many applications. If requestedService equals "planting", ask how many trees. Store the response under requestedServiceMagnitude.
	e) If requestedService equals "mowing", calculate the subtotal price by multiplying requestedServiceMagnitude by (35/5000). If requestedService equals "fertilizing", calculate the subtotal price by multiplying requestedServiceMagnitude by 30. If requestedService equals "planting", multiply requestedServiceMagnitude by 50. Increment totalPrice by the result.
	f) Repeat steps "b" through "e" until all three services have been selected.
	g) Print totalPrice so that the user knows how much they will be billed.
